# AI Projects : RL & COMPUTER VISION

- I share in this repository my AI personal projects that I am working on

- This repository contains mainly :

> Reinforcement learning projects:
>
> - In such projects , I experience different algorithms in different environments
> - Stating from cross entropy method to model-based algorithms

> Computer vision projects:
>
> - I share different projects using different architectures :
> - GANs , diffusion models , object detection , etc ...

> Taks to do:
>
> - Add index to different projects & architectures

# How to run the code :

## On local machine:

- If you have cuda powered machine , and you want to run the projects locally , execute the following commands :

## Windows :

```batch
conda env create -f environment.yml -n ai_projects_env
conda activate ai_projects_env
```

## Notice :

- You must install conda
- The projetcs are running in python 3.11

## Final word

- I wish this repository can help you in your personal projects , feel free to contact me on my social accounts ,let us talk about AI !
