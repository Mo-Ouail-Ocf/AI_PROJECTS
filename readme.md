# AI Projects: Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to my repository of personal AI projects! Here, I share the work I'm doing in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL).

## Contents

### Reinforcement Learning Projects

- These projects explore different algorithms across various environments.
- I experiment with methods ranging from the cross-entropy method to model-based algorithms.
- The projects include implementations of:
  - Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
  - Actor-Critic Methods
  - State-of-the-Art Algorithms
  - And many more

### Tasks to Do

- Add an index to organize different projects and algorithms.

## How to Run the Code

### On Local Machine

If you have a CUDA-powered machine and want to run the projects locally, follow these steps:

#### Windows

```batch
conda env create -f environment.yml -n ai_projects_env
conda activate ai_projects_env
```

### Notice

- Make sure you have Conda installed.
- The projects are compatible with Python 3.11.
